// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

ask for a number
check the number modulo 2 to see what the remainder is
if the remainder is 0 print even
if the remainder is not 0 print odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

ask for 5 numbers
add number1 + number2 + number3 + number4 + number5 store as SUM
divide SUM by 5 store as AVERAGE
group the numbers 1-5 into a list
find the minimum number from the list store as MIN
find the maximum number from the list store as MAX
print on screen "Average" = AVERAGE
print on screen "Minimum" = MIN
print on screen "Maximum" = MAX
